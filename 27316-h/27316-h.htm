<p class="hang mtb"><i>A Sermon delivered by</i> <span class="scaps">D. L. Moody,</span> <i>the Evangelist,
at the Great Chicago Tabernacle, Jan. 5, 1877.
Repeated in the Boston Tabernacle, April 29th.</i></p>
<p>
In 2 Timothy, 3:16, Paul declares: "All scripture
is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness;" but there are some people who tell
us when we take up prophecy that it is all very well
to be believed, but that there is no use in one trying
to understand it; these future events are things that
the church does not agree about, and it is better to let
them alone, and deal only with those prophecies
which have already been fulfilled. But Paul does not
talk that way; he says: "All scripture is ...
profitable for doctrine." If these people are right, he
ought to have said: "Some scripture is profitable;
but you can not understand the prophecies, so you had
better let them alone." If God did not mean to
have us study the prophecies, he would not have put
them in the Bible. Some of them are fulfilled, and he
is at work fulfilling the rest, so that if we do not
see them all completed in this life, we shall in the
world to come.</p>


<p>I do not want to teach anything to-day dogmatically,
on my own authority, but to my mind this precious
doctrine--for such I must call it--of the return of the
Lord to this earth is taught in the New Testament as
clearly as any other doctrine is; yet I was in the
church fifteen or sixteen years before I ever heard a
sermon on it. There is hardly any church that does
not make a great deal of baptism, but the New Testament
only speaks about baptism thirteen times, while
it speaks of the return of our Lord fifty times;
and yet the church has had very little to say about it.
Now, I can see a reason for this: the devil does not
want us to see this truth, for nothing would wake up
the church so much. The moment a man takes hold
of the truth that Jesus Christ is coming back again to
receive his friends to himself, this world loses its hold
upon him; gas-stocks and water-stocks, and stocks in
banks and horse-railroads, are of very much less consequence
to him then. His heart is free, and he looks
for the blessed appearing of his Lord, who at his
coming will take him into his blessed kingdom.</p>

<p>In 2 Peter 1:20, we read: "No prophecy of the
scripture is of any private interpretation." Some
people say: "O yes, the prophecies are all well enough
for the priests and doctors, but not for the rank and
file of the church." But Peter says: "The prophecy
came not by the will of man, but holy men spake as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost," and those men
are the very ones who tell us of the return of our
Lord. Look at Daniel 2:45, where he tells the meaning
of that stone which the king saw in his dream that
was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that
broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver,
and the gold. "The dream is certain and the interpretation
thereof sure," says Daniel. Now we have
seen the fulfillment of that prophecy all but the closing
part of it. The kingdoms of Babylon and Medo-Persia
and Greece and Rome have all been broken in
pieces, and now it only remains for this stone cut out
of the mountain without hands to smite the image and
break it in pieces till it becomes like the dust of the
summer threshing floor, and for this stone to become
a great mountain and fill the whole earth.</p>

<h3>BUT HOW IS HE GOING TO COME?</h3>

<p>We are told how he is going to come. When those
disciples stood looking up into heaven at the time of
his ascension, there appeared two angels, who said
Acts 1:11: "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus which is
taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven." How
did he go up? He took his flesh and bones up with
him. "Look at me; handle me; give me something
to eat; a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me
have; I am the identical one whom they crucified and
laid in the grave. Now I am risen from the dead and
am going up to heaven," Luke 24:39,43. He is
gone, say the angels, but he will come again just as he
went. An angel was sent to announce his birth of the
virgin; angels sang of his advent in Bethlehem; an
angel told the women of his resurrection; and two
angels told the disciples of his coming again. It is
the same testimony in all these cases.</p>

<p>I do not know why people should not like to
read the Bible, and find out all about this precious
doctrine of our Lord's return. Some have gone beyond
prophecy, and tried to tell the very day he
would come. Perhaps that is one reason why people
do not believe this doctrine. He is coming, we know
that; but just when he is coming we do not know;
Matt. 24:36, settles that. The angels do not know;
and Christ says that even he does not know, but that
is something the Father keeps to himself. If Christ
had said: "I will not come back for 2,000 years," none
of his disciples would have begun to watch for him,
but it is the proper attitude of a Christian to be always
looking for his Lord's return. So God does not tell
us just when he is to come, but Christ tells us to
watch. In this same chapter we find that he is to
come unexpectedly and suddenly. In the twenty-seventh
verse we have these words: "For as the
lightning cometh out of the east and shineth unto the
west, even so shall also the coming of the Son of Man
be." And again in the forty-fourth verse: "Therefore
be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think
not the Son of Man cometh."</p>

<p>Some people say that means death: but the Word
of God does not say it means death. Death is our
enemy, but our Lord hath the keys of death; he has
conquered death, hell, and the grave, and at any
moment he may come to set us free from death, and
destroy our last enemy for us; so the proper state for
a believer in Christ is waiting and watching for our
Lord's return.</p>

<p>In the last chapter of John there is a text that
seems to settle this matter. Peter asks the question
about John: "Lord what shall this man do? Jesus
said unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what
is that to thee? Follow thou me. Then went this
saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple
should not die." They did not think that the coming
of the Lord meant death; there was a great difference
between these two things in their minds.</p>

<h3>CHRIST IS THE PRINCE OF LIFE.</h3>

<p>There is no death where he is; death flees at his
coming; dead bodies sprang to life when he touched
them or spoke to them. His coming is not death; he
is the resurrection and the life, when he sets up his
kingdom there is to be no death, but life forevermore.</p>

<p>There is another mistake, as you will find if you
read your Bible carefully. Some people think that at
the coming of Christ everything is to be done up in a
few minutes; but I do not so understand it. The
first thing he is to do is to take his Church out of the
world. He calls the Church his bride, and he says he
is going to prepare a place for her. We may judge,
says one, what a glorious place it will be from the
length of time he is in preparing it, and when the
place is ready he will come and take the church to
himself.</p>

<p>In the closing verses of the fourth chapter of 1
Thessalonians, Paul says: "If we believe that Jesus
died and rose again, even so also them which sleep in
Jesus will God bring with him.... We which
are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord
himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God,
and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which
are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so
shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort
one another with these words." That is the comfort
of the church. There was a time when I used to
mourn that I should not be alive in the millennium;
but now I expect to be in the millennium. Dean
Alford says--and almost everybody bows to him in the
matter of interpretation--that he must insist that this
coming of Christ to take his church to himself in the
clouds is not the same event us that to judge the world
at the last day. The deliverance of the church is one
thing, judgment is another. Now, I cannot find any
place in the Bible where it tells me to wait for signs
of the coming of the millennium, as the return of the
Jews, and such like; but it tells me to look for the
coming of the Lord; to watch for it; to be ready at
midnight to meet him, like those five wise virgins.
The trump of God may be sounded, for anything we
know, before I finish this sermon--at any rate we are
told that he will come as a thief in the night, and at
an hour when many look not for him.</p>

<p>Some of you may shake your heads and say, "Oh,
well, that is too deep for the most of us; such things
ought not to be said before these young converts; only
the very wisest characters, such as ministers and professors
in the theological seminaries, can understand
them." But my friends, you find that Paul wrote
about these things to those young converts among the
Thessalonians, and he tells them to comfort one another
with these words. Here in the first chapter of
1 Thessalonians Paul says, "Ye turned to God from
idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for
his Son from heaven whom he raised from the dead,
even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to
come," To wait for his Son; that is the true attitude
of every child of God. If he is doing that he is ready
for the duties of life, ready for God's work; aye, that
makes him feel that he is just ready to begin to work
for God.</p>

<p>Then in 1 Thessalonians, 2:19, he says: "For what is
our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even
ye, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at his
coming?" And again, in the third chapter, at the
thirteenth verse, "To the end that he may establish
your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even
our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
with all his saints." Still again, in the fifth chapter,
"For ye yourselves know perfectly that the day of the
Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. But ye,
brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should over
take you as a thief." He has something to say
about this same thing in every chapter, indeed I have
thought this Epistle to the Thessalonians might be
called the gospel of Christ's coming again.</p>

<p>There are three great facts foretold in the word of
God: First, that Christ should come; that has been
fulfilled. Second, that the Holy Ghost should come;
that was fulfilled at Pentecost, and the church is able
to testify to it by its experience of his saving grace.
Third, the return of our Lord again from heaven--for
this we are told to watch and wait "till he come."
Look at that account of the last hours of Christ with
his disciples. What does Christ say to them? If I go
away I will send death after you to bring you to me?
I will send an angel after you? Not at all. He says:
"I will come again and receive you unto myself." If
my wife were in a foreign country, and I had a beautiful
mansion all ready for her, she would a good deal
rather I should come and bring her unto it than to
have me send some one else to bring her.</p>

<h3>THE CHURCH IS THE LAMB'S WIFE.</h3>

<p>He has prepared a mansion for his bride, and he
promises for our joy and comfort that he will come
himself and bring us to the place he has been all this
while preparing.</p>

<p>My friends it is perfectly safe to take the word of
God as we find it. If he tells us to watch, then watch!
If he tells us to pray, then pray! If he tells us he will
come again, wait for him! Let the church bow to the
word of God, rather than trying to find out how such
things can be. "Behold, I come quickly," said Christ.
"Even so, come, Lord Jesus," should be the prayer of
the church.</p>

<p>Take the account of the words of Christ at the communion
table. It seems to me the devil has covered
up the most precious thing about it. "For as often as
ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show forth the
Lord's death <i>till he come</i>." But most people seem to
think that the Lord's table is the place for self-examination
and repentance, and making good resolutions.
Not at all; you spoil it that way; it is to show forth the
Lord's death, and we are to keep it up till he comes.</p>

<p>Some people say, "I believe Christ will come
on the other side of the millennium." Where do you get
it? I cannot find it. The word of God nowhere tells
me to watch and wait for the coming of the millennium,
but for the coming of the Lord. I do not find any place
where God says the world is to grow better and better,
and that Christ is to have a spiritual reign on
earth of a thousand years. I find that the world is to
grow worse and worse, and at length there is to be a
separation. "Two women grinding at a mill, one taken
and the other left; two men in one bed, one taken
and the other left," Luke 17:34,36. The church is
to be translated out of the world, we have two examples
already, two representatives, as we might say, of
Christ's kingdom, of what is to be done for all his true
believers. Enoch is the representative of the first dispensation,
Elijah of the second, and, as a representative
of the third dispensation, we have the Saviour
himself, who is entered into the heavens for us, and
become the first fruits of them that slept. We are not
to wait for the great white throne judgement, but the
glorified church is set on the throne with Christ, and
to help to judge the world.</p>

<p>Now, some of you think this is a new and strange
doctrine, and that they who preach it are speckled
birds. But let me tell you that most of the spiritual
men in the pulpits of Great Britain are firm in this
faith. Spurgeon preaches it. I have heard Newman
Hall say that he knew no reason why Christ might
not come before he got through with his sermon. But
in certain wealthy and fashionable churches, where
they have the form of godliness, but deny the power
thereof,&mdash;just the state of things which Paul declares
shall be in the last days,&mdash;this doctrine is not preached
or believed. They do not want sinners to cry out in
their meeting, "What must I do to be saved?" They
want intellectual preachers who will cultivate their
taste, brilliant preachers who will rouse their imagination,
but they do not want the preaching that has in
it the power of the Holy Ghost. We live in the day
of shams in religion. The church is cold and formal;
may God wake us up! And I know of no better way
to do it than to get the church to looking for the
return of our Lord.</p>

<p>Some people say, "Oh, you will discourage the
young converts if you preach that doctrine." Well,
my friends, that has not been my experience. I have
felt like working three times as hard ever since I came
to understand that my Lord was coming back again.
I look on this world as a wrecked vessel. God has
given me a life-boat, and said to me, "Moody, save all
you can." God will come in judgment and burn up
this world, but the children of God do not belong to
this world; they are in it, but not of it, like a ship in
the water. This world is getting darker and darker;
its ruin is coming nearer and nearer; if you have any
friends on this wreck unsaved, you had better lose no
time in getting them off.</p>

<p>But some will say: "Do you then make the grace
of God a failure?" No, grace is not a failure but man
is. The antediluvian world was a failure; the Jewish
work was a failure; man has been a failure everywhere,
when he has had his own way and been left to himself.</p>

<h3>CHRIST WILL SAVE HIS CHURCH.</h3>

<p>But he will save them finally by taking them out of
the world. Now, do not take my word for it; look
this doctrine up in your Bible, and if you find it
there, bow down to it and receive it as the word of
God. Take Matthew 24:48,50: "But and if that
evil servant shall say in his heart, my Lord delayeth
his coming ... the Lord of that servant shall
come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour
that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder
and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Take 2
Peter 3:4,5: "There shall come in the last days
scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying,
where is the promise of his coming? for since the
fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were
from the beginning of the creation." Go out on the
streets of Chicago and ask men about the return of
our Lord, and that is just what they would say: "Ah,
yes, the Lord delayeth his coming!"</p>

<p>"Behold, I come quickly," said Christ to John, and
the last prayer in the Bible is, "Even so, come Lord
Jesus, come quickly." Were the early Christians disappointed
then? No; no man is disappointed who
obeys the voice of God. The world waited for the
first coming of the Lord; waited for 4,000 years, and
then he came. He was here only thirty-three years
and then he went away; but he left us a promise that
he would come again; and as the world watched and
waited for his first coming and did not watch in vain,
so now to them who wait for his appearing shall he
appear a second time unto salvation. Now let the
question go round, "Am I ready to meet the Lord if
he comes to-night?" "Be ye also ready, for in such
an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."</p>

<p>There is another thought I want to call your attention
to, and that is this: Christ will bring all our
friends, with him when he comes. All who have died
in the Lord are to be with him when he comes in the
clouds of heaven. "Blessed and holy is he that hath
part in the first resurrection: on such the second death
has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of
Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years,"
Rev. 20:6. "But the rest of the dead lived not
again until the thousand years were past; this is the
first resurrection" (verse 5). That looks as if the
church were to have a thousand years with Christ before
the final judgment, when Satan shall be cast out,
and there shall be new heavens and new earth wherein
dwelleth righteousness.</p>

<p>Now, I want to give you some texts to study.</p>

<div class="block">
<p>When we eat the Lord's supper we show forth his death,
until he come. 1 Cor. xi. 26.</p>
<p>We are using our talents, until he come.    Luke xix. 13.</p>
<p>We are fighting the good fight of faith, until he come. 1
Tim vi. 12-14.</p>
<p>We are enduring tribulation, until he come.   2 Thes. i. 7.</p>
<p>We are to be patient, until he come.    James v. 8.</p>
<p>We wait for the crown of righteousness, until he come. 2
Tim. iv. 8.</p>
<p>We wait for the crown of glory, until he come. 1 Pet. v. 4.</p>
<p>We wait for re-union with departed friends, until he come.
1 Thes. iv. 13-18.</p>
<p>We wait for Satan to be bound, until he come.   Rev. xx. 3.</p>
<p>And so let us watch and wait till he comes.</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<p>D. L. Moody, who is perhaps the most popular and efficient
preacher of the gospel of Christ in the world, to-day, is evidently
fully committed to a belief in the speedy coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to judge the world and establish his
eternal kingdom. Looking over the published reports of his
sermons in Great Britain and in this country, since the beginning
of 1874, I give extracts which go to show in a plain light
the man's inner love and hope as relates to the last things,
and his warm, bold, consistent manner of expressing the
same. Thousands pray, God bless D. L. Moody.</p>
</div>

<p>1. Mr. Moody proclaims that the grand symbols of
Daniel's, second and seventh chapters, announce four
dominant world empires, and but four, to cover all centuries
of human probation.</p>

<p>2. That these kingdoms are and were Babylon, Medo-Persia,
Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>3. That these have had their day of earthly supremacy
and the last has nearly passed away.</p>

<p>4. That the fifth kingdom of Daniel is God's, to
come in its order as the fifth, to overthrow all previous
kingdoms, to be a visible and eternal kingdom, and to
be established by Christ in person at his second coming.</p>

<p>5. That the stone cut from the mountain denotes
"Christ himself," "at his appearing and kingdom,"
whose advent "is not far distant," and for whose advent
"the whole creation groans." Rom. 8:19-22.</p>

<p>6. That the last days, described by our Saviour
in Matt. 24:37-39 as resembling the days of Lot and
Noah, are already here; observing, "I do not think the
day is far distant when our Lord will return." And
again, "just as judgment overtook Belshazzar carousing
at his feast, so will judgment come suddenly and
swiftly upon the world revelling in its sins."</p>

<hr />

<p>The foregoing he preached in the City Hall, Glasgow,
March 15th, 1874, before three thousand people. On
the same day he preached on "Christ's Second Coming"
in the Free church (Pres.), telling the churches that
every thirtieth verse in the New Testament bears on
that glorious coming; and says the <i>London Christian</i>,
"With his usual power he showed what a mighty motive
this doctrine is to all who are winning souls. He
himself had found it rousing him to ten-fold more effort
to save all that could be rescued from the coming
wreck."</p>

<p>In Philadelphia, in a discourse on Daniel's second
chapter, he said: "This dream has been nearly fulfilled
as Daniel interpreted it. In the present age the
prophecy is nearly completed, and the hour of the
Lord's second coming is close at hand." <span style="padding-left: 3em;">D. T. T.</span></p>
